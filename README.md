# Data Science Applications
This repository is a collection of notebooks on different (business) cases with AI/ML solutions. The repository is formed by actual business cases I worked on in practice, kaggle competitions and courses that I followed.

The notebooks usually contain a short introduction of the case, explanation of the dataset(s), exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, testing and evaluation and a final conclusion.
